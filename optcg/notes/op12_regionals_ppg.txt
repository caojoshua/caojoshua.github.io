OP12/PRB2 10/12/2025 regionals as bonney

1. 1-0 Teach. Won die roll took first.
  * Kept hand of koushirou, rosi, 5c bonney, hody, 2k. I think curve is good enough, but this would be better with cav/carrot.
  * He had stage -> shiryu to pop blocker. He couldn't clear the 5c bonney though. Dropped raw auger on 6 don.
  * I drew two more hody really early. Two was probably enough to win but #3 made the game way easier.
2. 1-0 Zoro. Won die roll took first.
  * He went hard face with restand event. I never countered a single time. I had 3-4 searches with one bonney and went two zero life with 12 cards in hand, including kid.
  * On 8 don he went kuina -> restand event to face. I knew he had mihawk though, better drop mihawk and save restand.
3. 1-0 UP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * Kept tashigi, cav, double mihawk, and 3c bonney. Ideally we get hody, 5c bonney, or smth better for 7 don turn, but hand is good enough imo.
  * He double bon clay, but no god thread. Cav stay alive for a long time.
  * He 2k'ed a bunch and only found one giant. Didn't need hody to win, just kept hitting with 2 mihakws and a doffy.
4. 0-1 RG Smoker. Won die roll took second.
  * He went sanji -> koby. A lot of people taking out sanji, but I think its still good.
  * I played 3c bonney on 4 don. Just learning that the card might not be that great in the MU cause of koby.
  * I went cav->tashigi, thinking I was smart cause tashigi would protect the bonney. I tunnel visioned and forgot that hody fucks me. Burned a million cards to protect cav but I think it was GG at that point.
  * Maybe I'm supposed to drop tashigi on three and play naked cav on 5? IDK doesn't feel good either way.
  * Maybe first is still better against smoker. Hody on curve is so tough to beat.
5. 1-0 Zoro. Lost die roll he took first.
  * Game was kinda close. No mihawk on curve, but I had bonney search + 5c bonney on 6 don-> cav + carrot on 8 don -> Doffy.
  * He had tashigi -> kuina -> tashigi
  * He had his one 9 zoro on life.
6. 1-0 blue Doffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He should take first imo.
  * curve cav -> hody. He didn't have jozu.
7. 0-1 Zoro. Won die roll took first.
  * Game was super cursed. Whiffed bonney search on turn 2. Had cav on 5 don, but just swung big on 7 don and played kid naked on 9 don. He had triple tashigi.
  * 3 doffies stuck in hand. On 10 don turn, he had two rested tashigis. Could've left kid standing to play around paradise waterfall, but I needed to push life at that point and a lot of zoros not running that card. Was correct to swing imo.
  * Despite all this game was kinda close. If I had 3k more counter I could protect kid and win.
8. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll he took second.
  * I had 3c bonney -> cav+koushirou -> carrot.
  * He played 2c boa and swung on 4 don. I think he shouldn't swing there to protect boa.
9. 1-0 Vegapunk. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He only had one nami early. He couldn't kill kid all game.
10. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll took second.
  * Hand was omega cracked, god wanted my top 32. Had tashigi, cav, bonney, chum blocker or smth like that. Then draw into bonney searcher for the cherry on top.
  * He did the typical stuff. I took the first two 5k's which I usually don't, but I wanted all my cards in hand.
  * Went down to one life on his 7 don turn. After going down to three he swung a bunch of 7s.
  * On 8 and 10 don played mihawk - > secret bonney. Then mihawk into carrot.
  * I think he needed to yolo unblockable me down to zero earlier. I had kid in hand, but since he kept on leaving me at one and I was using my blockers, I just kept blockering up again instead of playing kid. He played too slow and I was able to kill him the turn after I played kid.
