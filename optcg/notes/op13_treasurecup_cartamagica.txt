Playing as RU Ace

1. 1-0 Imu. lost die roll he took second.
  * Could only get him to 3 life by his exodia turn, but he used all 4 never existed (pitched one off leader eff). But he shirahoshied in 9 don to bottom two of them.
  * No blockbeard on curve. Went 9beard on 9, jammed roger in 10 to get him down to 2. Blockbeard turn after.
  * He pushed me to zero with 10 cards in hand, so I pudding'ed him. I had roger and blockbeard on board. I didn't want to lethal attempt though, since I knew he had two never existed in deck and hadn't used any 3k counters. I swung roger into nusjuro and hid behind blockbeard and marco with 8 cards in hand. Actually marco drew me into some dogshit, so if he full committed 7-7 at the end with my blockbeard up, I would have died with only 1k counter in a 4 card hand. I understand why he didn't go for this though, chances are super unlikely to go through. And the end, my last swing with roger, he was only 2k short of counter, so maybe he had some chance to live.
2. 0-1 Ace. lost die roll he took second.
  * I was super ahead. I got him down to zero with 5 or 6 cards in hand.
  * I misplayed at the end. I went yamato -> atmos on my last turn and went 6-6 (already had yamato on board). Should've dropped marco and played safe.
  * I had three cards to see between izo, life, and leader eff. Needed 4k total counter, but saw 2k, 1k, brick.
3. 1-0 lim. lost die roll he took second.
  * Swung 7, 7 into pudding on 5 don. Then jozu -> 9beard ->lethal.
  * His start weak. Played 3c lim on 4 don. No 6k body.
4. 1-0 imu (seven07). won die roll took second.
  * He didn't swing on 3 don which I think is strange.
  * I missed marco on 4, but I played searcher + swing 9. Then I jozu'ed double searcher.
  * He tapped out on 7 don, which let me go blockbeard and swing 8, 9. He warcury blocked one, and took the other to go down to two.
  * On 9 he played nusjuro and started swinging at my jozu, but it was all small swings so I protected. He didn't play blocker.
  * On 10 he countered out of 6 and 7. I swung 12 and then dropped roger, putting him down to zero. He only has two 5k bodies on board so hes giga cooked.
  * He told me after game that MU is cooked if you lose die roll as imu. Good to know good player isn't coping and knows its die roll meta.
  * bro has 5 op13 boxes, and I suspect theres more out of view. bro is loaded.
5. 1-0 imu. lost die roll he took second.
  * Weak curve. No 1 drop first two turns. Went yamato on 5, izo+jozu on 7 bouncing his shirahoshi, no don on leader. He went jupiter on 8, geting me down to 1 life, but I don't think this is trong since he had to tap out his warcury. On 9 I played blockbeard and took life since he had the jupiter out and swung 9 + 10. He took both going down to one.
  * I followed with 9beard just to live a turn. Then killed him with roger after. He had 7 cards in hand, one don up, one life, and I had 6+10+12+13. Too hard to live that.
  * I think he could leave more don up. Only one event in hand though. But he used 5 don before play the 10c, so he only had one don up after exodia. He should have swung one less and hope to search for event. He had lethal the next turn anyway. Instead he searched for the 10c, so I knew of at least one brick in hand.
6. 0-1 imu (Eric Quintana). won die roll took 2nd.
  * Game was cursed. No 1 drops, swing 10 on 4 don. Then play yamato, still no 1 drops. He played two shirahoshis that I couldn't deal with without 1 drops. On 6 don I went yamato swing 8 at face, knowing he just bottomed two rad beams with shirahoshi, but he had the 3rd in hand to stay at 3 life.
  * Game was so cursed. On 8 don I missed 8event. Went yamato into double 1 drop, but he had blocker so couldn't get him down to 2. He didn't find mars to remove my yamato on 9don. I was able to go 8 8 after playing blockbeard on 10, but he guard point + 1k'ed to stay at 3 life.
  * I was able to establish 2 blockbeards and roger survive. On last turn, he had 7 cards in hand, 3 don up, 3 life. I pudding'ed and planned for 11-12-13-13, but he had 7k counter in hand to survive the first hit. Chance I kill him was pretty low since I think he had 4 rad beams in deck.
  * He probably proced shirashi 5 times against me. I think I had to swing at face though to get him down to two.
  * Despite such a dogshit start, it was close. Was able to get two blockbeards+roger+pudding for attempt at game.
  * His cam died mid game. I let him play it out cause I trust him. It was kinda scuffed though his friend was holding the cam.
7. 0-1 Ace (sleepa). won die roll took 2nd.
  * he had atmos to bounce my marco into pudding on 7. I played jozu on 6, so no don on my leader. He swung 9 and I went down to one.
  * I think this is the only place where I could have maybe played differently.
    * On 8 don, I went garp and found pudding and swung 8-8. I figured the most punishing thing is if he finds 8event + blockbeard (which he did), but any other play isn't too scary. If he jozu's for example, I had garp+izo+8event to play out blockbeard, or I can just drop 9beard, which was in my hand. If he blockbeards after that, I have red roc read.
    * Mmaybe its better to just play marco. He had 8 cards in hand so it wasn't a super value pudding.
  * He had 8 event and took the life. IDK if its right to do that, seems like a gamble.
  * I played red roc and dropped marco, with 4 cards in hand. Had to gamble no roger, but he played it and killed me. Was praying he wouldn't go for it because I had all my 2k's in my deck, not a single in trash. I had 4 1k's in two bricks in hand, so 3k counter short. I think maybe he had to go for it, because of he blockered up he would be dead to roger.
  * The pudding RNG definently did not work out for me. He pudding me into nothing good, but I pudding him into 8event + blockbeard, and then he has roger.
8. 1-0 Imu (MissingLink). lost die roll he took 2nd.
  * Hand was ok. 1 drop -> swing 9 -> swing 7 + marco -> jozu. No don attach on 7 don.
  * He had two mistakes that let me push really hard:
    * On 8 don, he went for saturn + jupyter and turned his warcury sideways. Better play another warcury, or leave current warcury standing. This let me go blockbeard on 9 don, take life, and swing 9+10 to take him down to two life and force him to give me two cards.
    * On my turn 6, I went I am whitebeard + blockbeard2, giving dons to garp and swinging 5. He blocked with the warcury on the 5swing, which let me swing big with leader and blockbeard, taking him down to 1. At that point, I have two blockbeards and he has 1 life. Hes basically praying for no roger at that point.
9. 1-0 Imu. lost die roll he took 2nd.
  * I kept hand with otama, marco, double jozu, 8event. I think its good enough to keep. Marco is basically the same as yamato, and I'm just one blockbeard away from dream curve.
  * He did nothing on turn 1 -> saturn. On 5 I pudding'ed his 8 card hand, and swung 7. He didn't draw into counter event, so he took. At this point I think I'm super ahead.
    * Ideally you play out searcher girl and don't pitch her to play around pudding. And if not you can play warcury. He told me his hand sucks though and didn't mind getting pudding'ed.
  * On 6 he played warcury, and I was able to jozu the warcury. Game is cooked at this point.
  * On 9 I found the blockbeard and got two big swings. Then he was missing mars for the exodia turn, so he only had one blocker and I could just swing at him hard.
  * He was already cooked, but he didn't have his second 10c. He pitched two of them during the mid-game, which was a little sus.

Finished 6-3.
  * I need to get better at the mirror. I lost both of them, and I probably had opportunities to play better.
  * My loss against Eric Quintana was super cursed, can't be upset about it.
  * Feels great to beat 4 imus going first, but I do think its partially skill issue. Other than the last Imu who had cursed start, I think the rest could have played better.
  * Somehow dodged all Zoros. This would probably be a good thing for ace players, but I actually have really good results in the this MU. 23W/7L on sim at time of writing.
  * X-3 is not a great result, but its good considering I only won 3/9 die rolls in a die roll meta.
