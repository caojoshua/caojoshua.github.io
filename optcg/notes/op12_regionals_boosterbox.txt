OP12/PRB2 10/25/2025 regionals as bonney

1. 1-0 Zoro. Won die roll took first.
  * He missed tashigi on curve. I got a lot of value out of double bonney search -> kid -> doffy.
2. 1-0 RG Smoker. Lost die roll he took first.
  * He had sanji -> smoker + sanji.
  * I had turn where I probably should have sent hody and went for game. He had two life, and would've needed 2k off the top. After game found that he has double mole pistol in life.
  * He had 3 cards. I have doffy and carrot. He has mihawk standing and no don. If I hody he would need a 2k or trigger off life.
  * I swung 5 and 6 to get two cards out of hand. Then doffy at board. Played three blockers, but had 3 1ks and three bricks, even after 5c bonney.
  * He DMG'ed two blockers, and I was dead if he swung at face. Instead he killed carrot + 5c bonney.
  * I hodied for game. He actually had double mole pistol in life. If I went for hody last turn I was dead, but in hindsight it was still the correct play. Luck of the gods tbh.
3. 1-0 GP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He nami'ed into zorojuro. Then zurojuro -> SPUD. Didn't have second zorojuro. Then played naked luffytarou. IDK why he kept, seems he only had 1 nami and 1 SPUD, don't think its good enough.
  * He didn't starve at all, just went face. Didn't even swing at rested carrot.
  * Got me down to zero and I dropped kid.
4. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll took second.
  * His start was aight. Didn't play second luffy on curve. I had tashigi -> pedro.
  * Was actually a little close. He unblockabled me down to zero, and I didn't have kid and only had 10k counter in hand. I had hit him really hard to turn before and got him down to one, so I killed him was hody and a full board.
5. 1-0 Bonney. Lost die roll he took first.
  * giga cursed. On 4 don I double whiffed bonney search.
  * he was swinging at me and i was starving
  * he established zoro after I established kid. I think he could have been more conservative in leaving zoro standing.
  * After swinging with zoro and the rest of his board, I was able to hody and clear the zoro while having kid up since he had so few cards in hand.
  * I had one turn where he doffy stunned my board. I just played 5c bonney and swung 11 into a rested smoker (don't need to leave don up cause 3c bonney). I FORGOT TO ATTACH DON ON KID, but he didn't notice either. I should have just swung 10k and smoker probably dead anyway.
6. 1-0 GP Luffy. Won die roll took second.
  * He had the most cursed start of all time. Zero searchers. Just afk, no swing. First card he played was 6c luffy on 7 don.
  * He used 6c luffy effect once. I swung 11 at it and he countered out. Then swung 9 and he let it go.
  * Next turn I just swung three times to put him down to zero with 10ish cards in hand. He only played first sanji and pudding on zero life.
7. 1-0 GP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * I think he just swung too much. He wasn't starving and letting his characters turn sideways. I got a bunch of cards out of his hand just swing into zorojuro and spud.
8. 0-1 UP Luffy. Lost die roll he took first.
  * He went zorojuro -> bon clay + gear 2 -> 3 mihawks.
  * I had koushirou -> pedro -> cav + tashigi on 6. Would've really liked to see the mihawk. Also really short on 2ks this game. Had to block mihawk 9k swing into kid.
  * I hid behind kid since he was swinging at me. He never actually killed the kid I played on 8 don.
  * I double doffied his three mihawks. Then I had hody + kid + 2 doffies to go for game. He had 1 life 7 cards in hand. I knew he only had one more giant left, but that he likely had it. He had enough counter to live.
  * Last turn on stream. I'll find it.
9. 1-0 UP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * I had cav on curve, but no koushirou/tashigi.
  * He had bon clay -> god thread -> sanji + mihawk, I thought I was cooked.
  * On 7 don I whiffed a bonney search and 5c bonnied. Then he cleared with sanij + mihawk, I thought I was cooked.
  * 9 don mihawk + 5c bonney. He had like 8 cards in hand with 2 life. Seems unplayable for me.
  * He hit me down to two and pudding'ed me with 9 cards in hand. I drew into 2 doffies, and later drew the third doffy. Triple doffy while swinging with bonney + mihawk. He was just playing namis, so I never needed to stun more than 3 things. He arguably had some opportunities to swing with nami, or use it to block to save counter events in hand.
  * After three doffies, played a kid to stall a turn. Then hody for game.
10. 0-1 Enel. Lost die roll he took second.
  * I can't fucking believe I lost serial to this dogshit leader.
  * I had kid with 9 cards in hand and one life. I made a mistake and turned my mihawk sideways. He zeus'ed my 3c bonney and made me burn a lot of counter. I was still doing well though.
  * I triple doffied his board and was setting up for lethal. He had a turn where he swung 10 at me. I could've mihawk'ed and triple 1k'ed. I could've went for lethal when he had 5 cards in hand, 2 life, and I had mihawk, 3 doffies, and hody in hand. After the game he actually showed 0c event at the bottom, so lethal would not have been easy.
  * I let mihawk go, I thought I was chilling another turn with kid in hand. Actually I didn't have another blocker. I tried getting three swings into 10 ace but he countered all of them. He had 1k, 2 2ks, 0c event, and brick.

Finished 8-2, 12th place. First among the X-2s.
