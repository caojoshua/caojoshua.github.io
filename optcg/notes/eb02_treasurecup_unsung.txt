7-2 in treasure cup with usopp
1-0 nami - close game <5 cards in deck
1-0 RG smoker - won die roll went first. rebecca-kyros on curve gg
1-0 RG smoker - lost die roll went second. rebecca-kyros
0-1 lim - lost die roll. perfect curve gg.
1-0 nami - stomp
1-0 teach - lost die roll went first. No jesus on 4 don, and just played searcher cards. Should be bad MU since I'm not running Luffy or KingKong, but no jesus too slow
1-0 GP Luffy - lost die roll went second. On 6 don soldier+zoro to KO SPUD. No second SPUD, and no rebecca on curve, but game unplayable without 2nd SPUD
0-1 GP Luffy - won die roll went first. Cursed game. 4 2k's in starting hand. No stage/Kyros until 10 don despite playing a million searchers. Tapping leader for leo search and still not finding shit. He bottom decked all his stage so if I had rebecca kyros on curve it would have been pretty good for me.
1-0 Lucci - lmao
