Playing as rayleigh:

1-0 Buggy (not even a real counter to rayleigh, gigashit deck)
1-0 GP Doffy
1-0 Marco
1-0 P kata @HotDadNoKids . Really close, pretty sure bro was trolling with his lethal swings. He could've killed me maybe.
1-0 G Zoro. Super close, needed last card in hand to be a 2k, but it was a brick.
1-0 UP Luffy
1-0 UP Luffy
