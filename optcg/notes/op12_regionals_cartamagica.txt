Playing as bonney

1. 1-0 No show
2. 1-0 Zoro. Lost die roll, he took first.
  We both perfect curved. He had 3 searchers -> tashigi -> tashigi -> mihawk+tashigi. I had cav -> mihawk+carrot -> Doffy + Kid. Pretty sure bonney's perfect curve is just better.
3. 0-1 Teach. Lost die roll he took first.
  Two 7c teaches I couldn't answer. Game was cooked.
4. 0-1 Smoker. Lost die roll he took first.
  He curved sanji -> smoker -> hody -> hody and killed me at 9 don. He should have mihawk on 9 don for safer play, but he had exact lethal. I curved tashigi -> cav -> carrot + 5c bonney, but just lost too much life.
5. 1-0 Kuzan. Won die roll took second.
  He afk swung on 3 and 5 don. No searchers.
6. 1-0 Lucci. Lost die roll he took second.
  He played 3 4c kuzan -> 10c kuzan, but couldn't KO anything. I did raphterra starve strat and got him down to 0 life in one turn after his 10zan. he was able to clear all but one 5c bonney and establish two rebecca, but I just shanks the 10zan and played it slow. Had hody in hand the whole time if ever needed.
7. 1-0 Koala. Won die roll took second.
  triple bonney search on 4 don hes cooked.
8. 1-0 Rayleigh. Lost die roll he took second.
  No luffy, no cav all game. But bad rayleigh start loses to bad bonney start.
9. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll took second.
  Curved decently well, he only had 1 luffy. Almost lost on time and had to tell him to play faster.
10. 1-0 UP Luffy (epl). Won die roll took first.
  He double ramp into sanji->nami. I did koushirou -> cav -> hody -> hody, too fast for him.
