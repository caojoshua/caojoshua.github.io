Playing as bonney

1. 0-1 UP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * m4xd. I beat him two weeks ago with triple doffy. It was actually a pair down and I was his only loss. He finished X-1 but bubbled out of a serial.
  * My start was mostly decent. 3c bonney -> cav + koushirou. Weak 7 don turn, search + tashigi. Kid on 9 don.
  * He had double bon clay -> sanji + mihawk to bottom the tashigi. Then he found red roc off of top stack to bottom the kid.
  * I had doffy -> shanks -> doffy, I thought I was winning. He had two 9k bodies and a nami on board. I only had one life he dropped a bon clay. I wanted to drop doffy #3, but I would've died to bon clay + nami swings.
    * In hindsight, the best he could do was 13+13, or 12+14. I had 9k counter in hand so I could've lived. He still could've killed me with the 8c luffy though, which he only used one of.
    * I had two doffies, shanks, and 1c bonney on board. I swung out and searched, planning to double blocker. I actually found kid and played that instead with 3c bonney. He god thread'ed my bonney, and he had bon clay 11k swing, two 9ks, leader, and nami swings. I was 3k off living.
    * I could've instead took a 1k counter and played double blocker. He actually showed after double ussohachi in hand, which would've killed me. He didn't use an ussohachi this game so double ussohachi is not too unlikely.
    * In hindsight I think best play is doffy. Don't play around the 8c luffy. He could swing 11k first, and I would burn 7k counter, leaving me with 2k. Then he can 8luffy and swing 8+9, and I would die.
2. 1-0 no show
3. 1-0 no show
4. 1-0 UP Luffy. Won die roll took first.
  * I had god curve tashigi -> cav -> hody -> mihawk + 2nd cav. He missed ramp on 4, then gear 2'ed and hit ramp off life for leader effect on turn 4. He played 9c luffy and killed my first cav, but I was too ahead at that point. He never removed tashigi all game. Double doffied him into hody for game.
5. 1-0 Bonney. Lost die roll he took second.
  * We afk'ed each other at 5 cards at board including kid on each side for 5+ turns. I had more cards in hand due to bonney searches. I had 17 at some point, and he only had 11ish. He eventually broke with hody, and I was super ahead. I was planning to break with hody. Breaking usually is bad, but the game was taking too long and I still had good chances with >5 more cards in hand advantage. I ended the game with 7 cards in deck.
6. 0-1 GP Luffy Chris Pak. Lost die roll he took second.
  * I curved carrot -> hody -> hody. I think I was pretty ahead.
  * He had zorojuro -> spud -> spud.
  * We got in the time scramble, I fucked up a lot and he probably did too. Ended with 1 minute left. I probably had some opportunities to swing more with my blockers, played too much around DMG. I had kid at zero life but made a bunch of misplays, I think I was favored in that situation.
7. 1-0 no show???
8. 0-1 Teach (Lafinte), lost die roll he took first.
  * stage -> doc q -> kuzan -> 7 teach.
  * I apoo'ed the doc q and stuck a tashigi -> cav. wasn't enough though. On 9 don, he used existing auger + 7 teach and double stronger + another 7 teach to clear both cav + mihawk. I had no hodies this game. Drew 2 mihawk and 3 doffies.
  * Finished in 6 minutes lmao.
  * Finished in 6 minutes lmao.
9. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll went second.

Finished 6-3, but with three no shows.
