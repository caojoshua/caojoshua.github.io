Playing as bonney

1. 1-0 yellow kid. won die roll went second.
2. 1-0 GP Luffy. lost die roll he took second.
  * He was swinging, got me down to zero on turn 4. I dropped kid and mostly chilled the whole game. On his turn 4 he played 6 luffy with only one spud and used his eff, so he was super starved of don the whole game.
3. 1-0 UP Luffy. lost die roll he took first.
  * He kept and went zorojuro -> gear2 -> blind sanji miss.
  * I had rosi -> nothing -> cav with no protection. If he cleared cav I was cooked.
  * On 8 don I went hody and started going face.
4. 1-0 Betty. won die roll took first.
  * really strong start for him. betty searcher -> kuma (killing bonney searcher) + raise max -> 5ivankov + karasu
  * I went 1bonney -> 1bonney + koushirou -> search + 5c bonney. No carrot or cav.
  * went down to zero on his 9 don turn. I had found 7 bricks by this time. I thought I was cooked.
  * He was too low on cards and I managed to infinite blocker. I had a bonney search into 5c bonney, which was probably necessary to de-brick.
  * He had a turn with 2k koala and inazuma in hand. He used inazuma for lead eff. Probably should keep the inazuma for rush threat. He had been swining smaller and playing small body to play around doffy, but better just keep inazuma to beat doffy.
5. 1-0 UP Luffy. won die roll took first.
  * I went koushirou -> cav swing 7, he hit g blade off life bottoming my cav. Then my best follow up was carrot pass, can't even swing cause of bagua.
  * He had gear 2 -> rosi no eff -> mihawk (no lead eff) -> sanji + mihawk. I thought I was giga fucked at this point.
  * I had mihawk -> mihawk -> doffy. He swung aggressively and I couldn't live again. He had 8 cards in hand, 4 don up, and a nami with one life. I went hody and swung 8, 8, 8, 8, 10. He had 3 2k's 3 1k's, but no events so he couldn't counter out of the last 8k. Super lucky win.
  * He said he didn't play around hody cause I shouldn't go for it, since he has so many cards in hand and only used one giant so far. I think thats a mistake. He put me in a position where I can't live another turn, so I HAVE to hody. He should've played nami over one of his bodies and try to find more counter.
6. 1-0 Rayleigh. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He had double shaki -> luffy + brook. I played pedro on 5, forcing the mole pistol. Then I had carrot -> mihawk + 5c bonney, and his tempo was too slow.
7. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll took second.
  * deck check before round.
  * He passed 1 don and swung 5 on 3, then he didn't swing until 7. My start was good enough with 3c bonney and cav + carrot, but I did get a bit starved. He was swining at my board only. Was able to get through with 1 doffy and 1 shanks.
8. 1-0 Rayleigh. Lose die roll he took second.
  * I missed 3c bonney, pedro, and cav. I double searched on 5 don.
  * He had double searcher but missed luffy. He luffied on 6 don into a shaki.
  * Both had weak start, but I started to stabilize with carrot on 7 and mihawk + 5c bonney on 9, followed by doffy.
  * I had double doffy, but couldn't find kid. I was forced to go for game after the second doffy.
  * On second doffy, I swung out with my board, including my pedro blocker. I had 10k counter in hand, enough to counter out of kidkiller + gatling.
  * He played zoro and swung 11, leaving 1 don up. I think this was a huge mistake. I countered out and hodied for lethal. If he just swung 9 and left 3 don up, his rad beam would've been active and no way I could have killed him. He had set up for unblockable, so he just needed to hope I didn't draw into last doffy or one of two kids.
9. 0-1 UP Luffy (Chris Sok). Win die roll took first.
  * I kept hand with 1c bonney, koushirou, carrot, hody, shanks. This is the god hand if I draw in cav. I top deck cav on 5 don like the goat.
  * He had bon clay -> god thread -> mihawk -> sanji + 8c luffy.
  * I shanks his first big drop into doffy. I probably would've won with doffy #2. He had nami and 4 don up with 8 cards in hand. I had hody, doffy, shanks on board with hody in hand. He used three giants. I only had one life and he had three big bodies on board. I had to hody here. He ended up countering out of my last shanks swing with 3 2k's.
  * He unintentionally bm'ed me. My first swing was 8, and he giant'ed and gave me an extra 1k. He had exact counter anyway, but if he kept the 1k he would be 1k over.

Finished 8-1, losing in the finals and getting 2nd place, barely by tie breaks. Good way to close out op12. This is my first serial, and I got an uncut sheet as well. This might be my last event I play as bonney.
Getting super lucky in round 5 against UP into seeing three Rayleighs into finals was a blessing. Also got lucky rount 8, where my opponent could've played better.
Chris Sok is the goat. He won three big events in op12. I asked him how he keeps winning, and he said he just gets lucky. TBH you do need that as UP Luffy.
