OP12/PRB2 10/18/2025 regionals as bonney

1. 1-0 bonney. won die roll took second.
  * Both of us starved. Super stomp. Had two bonney searchers. Whiffed second search, but they made him turn his board sideways, and I was just ahead whole game.
  * I played him last round of ppg regionals last week. He finished X-3 with high tiebreaks. Hes pretty good, maybe he can carry my tiebreaks today.
2. 1-0 rayleigh. won die roll took second.
  * Had koushirou -> cav -> mihawk + carrot GG
3. 1-0 UP Luffy. won die roll took first.
  * Won with seconds left in overtime. Had to hurry him, he was taking forever on his top stacks. He spent over three minutes on his first turn in overtime, then I killed him.
  * I think he went face too hard. He red roc'ed mihawk early. I just kid walled. I had set up a cav and shanks, so I got a bunch of swings while hiding behind kid.
  * Was almost cooked, he double bon clay -> sanji + 8luffy -> red roc -> sanji + mihawk.
4. 0-1 UP Luffy. won die roll took first.
  * 3c bonney -> cav, but he had lead performer -> god thread -> sanji + rosi -> 8c doffy + rosi. Went down to zero really early and he killed me.
5. 1-0 Enel. Won die roll took second.
  * This leader sucks. Didn't even shanks or doffy this game. Swung and cleared board of 10enel, ace, yamato, double kata
6. 1-0 Rayleigh. Won die roll took second.
  * carrot -> no mole pistol -> cav + 5c bonney hes cooked
7. 1-0 Rayleigh. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He had double luffy which made me nervous. I had 3c bonney -> carrot -> cav + pedro -> shanks.
  * He opted to play second luffy on 6 instead of mole pistol, not sure if I agree with it.
8. 1-0 UP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He kept, but he did zorojuro -> afk. Guess he had bagua but I'm not swinging at him.
  * I had bonney searcher -> koushirou -> cav. Then on his afk turn I just double searched hoping for 5c bonney but didn't find it.
  * He starved me and I bottomed three hodies on my second search so I was pretty concerned. But was able to win by hiding behind kid and swinging with kid, mihawk, and cav
9. 0-1 GP Luffy. Lost die roll he took second.
  * He had standard zorojuro -> spud + zorojuo -> luffytarou + spud
  * He wasn't starving at all which I'm not sure if its correct.
  * He got me down to zero by my 10 don turn. Couldn't doffy safely.
10. 1-0 UP Luffy. Lost die roll he took first.
  * He had zorojuro -> god thread -> double god thread on my 6 don cav + tashigi. I had prepped cav -> mihawk + 5c bonney, but ended up settling for mihawk swing 8.
  * I played carrot + 5c bonney on 10 don. I thought I was super cooked. Couldn't find another cav.
  * His first leader effect was sanji -> rosi. He later played another rosi. I had two hody in hand but they never felt that strong.
  * Triple doffy chain into hody for game.

Finished 8-2 31st place.
