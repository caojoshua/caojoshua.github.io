## Tournament Results

[Limitless profile](https://onepiece.limitlesstcg.com/players/3334) - Limitless captures most tops, but its not always consistent. For example, I got top 32 in PPG and PlayTCG OP12 regionals, but only the latter only posted top 16.

## Other stuff

* I won the [TCG Matchmaking box tournament #58](https://discord.com/channels/1111408561499676753/1205312557355638867/1432460503329935360) with R Rayleigh, going 7-0.
  * It was a bucket list item to win this event when I first started playing the game, and I finally won it. I probably had played >15 times, making the finals once before and the quaterfinals three times before. I don't think I will play this event again since it is really time consuming waiting for opponents to finish, and the competition is not that good until later rounds.
  * This qualified me to play the second pirate king of the hill (see box tournament link), where I beat Szychu in the Ace mirror 2-1, and lost to DogOfWisdom in the Ace mirror 0-3. Skepas won the event beating DogOfWisdom 4-2. See the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIAArhlsh9E).
